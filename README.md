# poof.py
Poof was designed to spoof the (Find My Friends / Find My iPhone) location of your iOS device remotely to any desired location.

This is based on manwhoami's work, which seems to have been pulled from his repo. My goal is to make this service publicly available again, while integrating some minor improvements.
